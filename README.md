data-structures
===============

This code was an experiment some time ago in using canvas to animate data structures.  It was naively and poorly written
and structures are lacking as I moved onto other means of teaching C.S.  I'm working extensively with a browser-based IDE
with the intention of hooking into the debugger to present intuitive animations of graph-search, pathfinding and
tree-generation algorithms in A.I.

I've further developed my structure library elsewhere and am currently open to learning animation strategies that may
apply.  My expectation is that with the size of the state-spaces I've encountered since writing this, be best option will
be a WebGL infinity-zoom style inspection.  For this reason development has stagnated.

Please note that I had no understanding of how animation actually worked at the time this was written.
This was both intentional and desirable, and this library should not be used for anything whatsoever.
